# Drone

## Disclaimer
This is drone was created in the winter term 2014 by students in the mechatronics/robotics degree course. It was added to the ProjectKitchen for further development

## Description
The projects aim was to create an inexpensive drone that could be used for swarm experiments. It comprises of the following components:
- A flight controller (MultiWii 328p available at Hobbyking)
- A MOSFET-Driver with DC-motors (can be substituted with brushless motors & ESCs)
- A Bluetooth HC06 module for communication (should be substituted with a WiFi-module)
- A Arduino Micro for communication & as a possible hook for swarm algorithms

## ToDo
- Get a battery for that drone
- Modify the base to be printed on our 3D-printer
- Get stronger motors for acrobatic flights
